Instructions:

Drop the "meowskulls" folder containing the .mdl and .bmp files into your Sven Co-op player folder.
Resulting directory should look something like this:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\svencoop\models\player\meowskulls"
Now just boot up Sven Co-op and select the character in Options>Multiplayer>Player Model.
