thanks for downloading "7-2 in Half-Life"!!!
the map features plenty of changes for the sake of gameplay and being actually
traversible. expect to find different ways to reach certain areas you'd normally use
mobility for in UK.
one feature you should know about is that secrets store weapons that you keep on death,
so get as many as you can!!

latest update: 
 - fixed terrain alignment near the bomb building that caused it to slightly obstruct the railway
 - added floating checkpoint text above the checkpoint portal at the start to make it clear what it does right away
